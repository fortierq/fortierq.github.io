[Magic](https://magic.wizards.com/en) is a card game (played both [online](https://magic.wizards.com/fr/mtgarena) and IRL) in which you have to build a pile of cards (*deck*) to play against other players. The number of cards in a deck can be large (between 40 and 100, most of the time) and listing them (to attend a tournament or sell them, for example) can be tedious. In this article, I describe the development of **mtgscan**, a recognition tool to automatically list cards. 

## Overview
More precisely, given an image of Magic cards, we want to produce the cards names (upper-left on the card). For example:

## Text recognition (OCR)

## Post-processing

## Results

## Web application with Flask

## REST API
